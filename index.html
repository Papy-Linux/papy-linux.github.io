    <h2>Web-only</h2>
    <p>Papy Linux is a web-only "kiosk"-like distribution. That means, Firefox is the only app, it's opened at boot and can't be closed. No other apps are available, apart from a terminal for debugging.</p>
    <h2>Simpler access to the functions</h2>
    <p>The main functions of the OS, it is, the homepage, the navigation and the shutdown of the computer, are simple buttons. Everything is done in one click. It is no more required to go in the start menu, click "Shutdown", click "Shutdown" a second time, and confirm you want to quit even though there are open applications.</p>
    <h2>No unexpected behaviours</h2>
    <p>We stripped as much unexpected things as possible. There are few chances you get a notification or a popup asking for things you don't care about like updates or some websites asking for permissions. Plus, with <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> and <a href="https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/">I don't care about cookies</a>, these popups are disabled even on websites!</p>
    <h2>Simple installation</h2>
    <p>Despite of it being in command-line, the installation is easy as ABC. It just asks you a few questions and does everything for you.</p>
